## 0.Introduction to Tries

We want to implement a Dictionary with 3 major functions:

- addWord

- Search

- Remove Word

![](images/1.png)

The Hashmaps we used for the string, they take time corresponding to the length of our string...

So, we are able to calculate the "Hashcode" for that particular string... 

--

l    ->    Word Length

- So, If we use Hashmap then the "addWord" time complexity will be: O(Word Length).

- For "Search", we have to figure out the HashCode. So, the time complexity will be: O(Word Length).

-  For "Removing" the word, we need a "Hash code". So, again the Time Complexity will be: O(l).

--

**<u>Trie</u>**:

![](images/2.png)

- Here, for every node, there are at max 26 children (i.e. A-Z)

- Here, the time complexity for the "addWord" is: <mark>O(Word Length)</mark>

-

<img src="images/3.png" title="" alt="" width="593">

- In above Example, only those Node are Darked where word got finish (OR) Terminate. 

-

![](images/4.png)

- Here, the time complexity for the "search" is: O(Word Length)

-

Now, for removing the word:

![](images/5.png)

Terminal which is dark, is got removed; representing the letter has no ending word...

- Here, the time complexity for the "remove" is: O(Word Length)

-------------

## 1.TrieNode class

- One of the Advantage of Tries is that we can Optimise Space in comparision to Hashmaps.

- Fast searching in Trie.

- We need to find the path from Root to the Leaf.

Due to these reasons we are not using Hashmaps in making of our Dictionary. So, we are using Trie.

--

We need to make a class "TrieNode"

![](images/6.png)

- Here, for every node, there are at max 26 children (i.e. A-Z) and we need to save their Addresses in Array.

--

We want to create an Array where in Every Index we want to store Address of Integer variable... (OR) We need to create an Array of Integer pointers.

![](images/7.png)

-

    int ** b    =>    b is a pointer variable which holds address of int *.
    
    
    int *a    =>    a is a pointer variable which holds address of Integer... 

NOTE: If we want to create an array of Integer pointers then we need to receive its address in a double pointer...

--

    TrieNode ** children = new TrieNode*[26]

Here, we want to create an Array and we want to save an Address of TrieNode in every index of the Array...

In above, All value should be of <mark>TrieNode*</mark>.

    TrieNode ** children  =>  Children Pointer which holds Address of TrieNode* type value...

--

Now, we need to store at which node, our any word got finish...

## 2.Tries Implementation -  Insert

![](images/9.png)

-

<u>Example</u>:

Process to insert any word in the "Trie".

<u>Example</u>:

<img src="images/11.png" title="" alt="" width="607">

--

In recursion:

- <u>Small calculation</u>: We will check is there is any children of Root with the First character of the data...?? If No, then we will create a new Node and make that node as children...

- <u>Recursive Call</u>: will be inserting of remaining words in the sub-Tree.

- <u>Base case</u>: When word length will be Zero, we will stop... and will make the Node as Terminal...

## 5.Tries Implement - Remove

<img src="images/17.png" title="" alt="" width="579">

--

![](images/18.png)

We are deallocate the useless nodes...

--

<img src="images/19.png" title="" alt="" width="423">

If we want to remove any Node from the Trie which only a parent can do...

--

<img title="" src="images/20.png" alt="" width="465">

Any word is useless when: 

- It's isTerminal will be false (i.e. At that node there is no end of any word) and

- second condition is that there should be no further children of that node...

Example:

```cpp
//Not working

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class TrieNode {
    public :
    char data;
    // Now we need an Array in which we want to store Address of each children
    TrieNode **children;
    bool isTerminal;
    
    TrieNode(char data) {    // Constructor
        this -> data = data;
        children = new TrieNode*[26];
        isTerminal = false;
    }
    
};

class Trie {            // Here, we will built our "Trie"
    TrieNode *root;
    
    public:
    
    Trie( ) {
        root = new TrieNode('\0');
    }
    
    //search
    bool search(TrieNode *root, string word) {
        if(word.size() == 0) {
            return root -> isTerminal;
        }
        
        // Small Calculations:
        int index = word[0] - 'a';
        TrieNode *child;
        if(root -> children[index] != NULL) {
            child = root -> children[index];
        }
        else{
            return false;
        }
        
        //Recursive Call
        return search(child, word.substr(1));
    }
    
    bool search(string word){
        return search(root, word);
    }
    
    void insertWord(TrieNode *root, string word) {
        // Base case:
        if(word.size() == 0) {
            root -> isTerminal = true;
            return;
        }
        
        // Small Calculations:
        int index = word[0] - 'a';
        TrieNode *child;
        if(root -> children[index] != NULL) {
            child = root -> children[index];
        }
        else{
            child = new TrieNode(word[0]);
            root -> children[index] = child;
        }
        
        // Recursive Call
        insertWord(child, word.substr(1));
    }
    
    // For User...
    void insertWord(string word) {
        insertWord(root, word);
    }
    
    void removeWord(TrieNode *root, string word) {
        // Base case
        if(word.size() == 0) {
            root -> isTerminal = false;
            return;
        }
        
        // Small Calculation
        TrieNode *child;
        int index = word[0] - 'a';
        if(root -> children[index] != NULL) {
            child = root -> children[index];
        }
        else {
            // Word not found
            return;
        }
        
        removeWord(child, word.substr(1));
        
        // Remove child Node if it is useless
        if(child -> isTerminal == false) {
            for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if(child -> children[i] != NULL) {
                    return;
                }
            }
            delete child;
            root -> children[index] = NULL;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Trie t;
    t.insertWord("and");
    t.insertWord("are");
    t.insertWord("dot");
    
    cout << t.search("and") << endl;
    
    t.removeWord("and");
    cout << t.search("and") << endl;
}
```

<u>Output</u>:

## 6.Types of Tries

The reason we choice the Tries over Hashmap in order to create a Dictionary:

- Space Optimisation

- Fast Searching

In case of "Hashmaps"; We need to check at every word that our Word starts with our searching LETTER or NOT...

![](images/21.png)

<u>Types</u>:

<u>Compressed Tries</u>: (We use it because of Space Optimisation)

<img title="" src="images/22.png" alt="" width="511">

In above diagram, square represents that here multiple characters are lying...

<u>Example</u>:

<img src="images/23.png" title="" alt="" width="578">

<u>Note</u>:

- During Insertion, we need to take the Decision of Clubbing...

- Sometimes we need to ungroup our Words...

- e.g.: During Deletion of word "bell", we need to club "ear" together in word "bear".

![](images/24.png)

We need to see "Pattern matching", for this we need to remove "isTerminal".

--

<u>Example</u>:

![](images/25.png)

<u>Suffix Tries</u>: Whenever we want to insert a word, we need to add all possible "Suffixes" in our Trie.

<u>NOTE</u>: In case of "Pattern Matching",We can search any random pattern which can be a Word or NOT, For that we need to have all possible Patterns present in our Trie... so, We will use "Suffix Tries".

<u>Example</u>:

<img src="images/26.png" title="" alt="" width="497">

## 7.Huffman Coding

Here, Disscussion is on "Text Compression"

Text Compression: Basically refers to reduction of amount of space required for saving a Particular Text...

- Somehow, Let's try to reduce the space requirement for the most Frequently occuring Character... If in this process if the space requirement of other characters increase then still we are Okay...
  
  <u>Example</u>:

![](images/27.png)

F    =>    File (which contains Characters)

a    =>    From 8 bites (1 Byte) to 3 bites

b    =>    From 8 bites (1 Byte) to 12 bites

a    =>    From 8 bites (1 Byte) to 11 bites

-

![](images/28.png)

<u>Steps</u>:

- First step is to go and figure out the count of every character which is present in the File (with the help of an Array) and we need to maintain a list...

- After that we need to pick up 2 characters of minimum count... (We need to use Min. Priority Queue) and club them to make a 3rd entry...

- This 3rd entry and out of all remaining entries, again we need to pick 2 characters of minimum counts... and this will continue... till our list will not be completely empty...

-  We need to calculate the path from Root to Leaf...

- There are two paths left and right, we need to assign 0 to the left and 1 to the right.

- We need to save the codes (respective of character) in Hashmaps...

-

Here, we are replacing every character to its respective code (Note: Code should be save in the form of Bits (not character or integer)).

![](images/29.png)

This is how compression will happen...

--

Now, Decompression of File (F): (From code to Character)

NOTE: Prefix of Code of any Character is never been code of any other character...
